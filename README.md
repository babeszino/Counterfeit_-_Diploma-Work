# Counterfeit

A fast-paced 2D top-down shooter with randomly generated level sequences.

## Controls

- **Movement**: W, A, S, D keys
- **Aim/Look**: Mouse movement (character always faces cursor)

## Game Objective

Eliminate all enemies on each level, then proceed through the exit door that opens when all enemies are defeated. Complete all five levels to finish the game.

Each level provides you with a specific weapon:
1. Baseball bat (melee weapon)
2. Glock 18 (semi-automatic pistol)
3. Double barrel shotgun
4. M4 (automatic assault rifle)
5. Rocket launcher

Score points by eliminating enemies and earn bonus points for killstreaks (double, triple, and multi-kills). Your completion time for each level also provides a score multiplier - the faster you clear a level, the higher your score!
